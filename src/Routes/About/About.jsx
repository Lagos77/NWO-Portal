                    <p>It's taken as a side project to be able to challenge myself and learn new techniques while building this website.</p>
                    <p>Why I chose this type of side project is partly to be able to share with me the knowledge I carry, experience and to inform my loved ones, even acquaintances, about how the world is really painted.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that this is a way for me to share my point of view on corruption and should not be taken as pure facts before examining it yourself.</p>
                    <p>The website will contain pictures, names of people, references to various events that have happened in the world and will happen, holy books and much more</p>
